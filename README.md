# Program Analysis Note

## Tool

Here are some tools for program analysis. I strongly recommend you to implement algorithms on them.

- `LLVM`: the `Clang Static Analyzer` is a awesome tool to analyze C/C++ from AST level. And `LLVM Pass` provides a more low-level IR to analyze.
- `Soot`: tools for Java program anlysis and optimization
- `BAP`: Binary Analysis Platform. Written in OCaml. We can inspect customize IR `BIL` to analyze different binary.
- `Angr`: Binary Analysis and Symbolic Exectuion

## Project

- [Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer): Source code static analysis based on OCaml
+ BAP based
  - [CWE-Checker](https://github.com/fkie-cad/cwe_checker): Binary analysis based on BAP

## Intro

Normally, the basic parts include dataflow analysis frameword (reaching definition, interval analysis, ...), pointer analysis (andreson and steensgaard), and abstract interpretation (sign analysis). You are also encouraged to learn discrete math to understand the notations in text books.

## General Courses

- Static Analysis:
  - [UW CSE 501](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse501/15sp/): Personally recommend, the contents are more compacted.
  - [CMU CS17-355](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/courses/17-355-19sp/): Some slides are missing. And the contents focus on security stuff more. Recommend to use notes here and slides from UW
  - https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/ementa/
  - [IOWA CS513X](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~weile/cs513x/): The topic is about staitc analysis but slighlty more depth.
  - [MIT 16.399](http://web.mit.edu/16.399/www/#schedule): Abstract Interpretation, in a more math way.
- Program Synthesis and Model Checking
  - [UW CSE599](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599a2/15wi/): Advanced Computer-Aided Reasoning for Software
  - [CMU CS15-414](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15414/schedule.html): Model Checking
  - [MIT 6.820](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-820-fundamentals-of-program-analysis-fall-2015/): Focused on abstract interpreter and model checking.
- SMT:
  - [UW CSE 507](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse507/): SMT solver and apllications
  - [CMU 15816](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/15816-f19/): Automated Reasoning and Satisfiability
- Books:
  - [SPA Book](https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/spa.pdf): Personally recommend. This book is static analysis oriented. It also provied a toy language analyszer. The psedu-code and syntax are better the PPA.
  - Principle of Program Analysis: Old school book. The syntax is abstract. Might be too hard to understand.

## Abstract Interpretation
  - Abstract Interpretation Course: [16.399 by MIT](http://web.mit.edu/16.399/www/)

## Porgram Slicing:
  - [Program Slicing Handbook](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~chechik/courses06/csc2125/tip95survey.pdf): For some values your analyzer intereted, we can slice the program to find related part of the program which impacts thos values.

## Binary Analysis

- [Analyzing Memory Accesses in x86 Executables](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/wpis/papers/cc04.pdf): Introduce **value-set analysis**. This analysis uses an abstract domain for representing an over-approximation of the set of values that each data object can hold at each program point.
